###### Final project of 18797 Machine Learning in Signal Processing

## Vehicle motion prediction using Kalman Filter control
Final code in main folder

- main.m: Implemented by Owen and Parth, edited by Prasad and Frank
- KFControlInline.m: Implemented by Owen and Parth, edited by Frank
- KFControlEstimateInline.m: Implemented by Owen and Parth
- optimalControl2Inline.m: Implemented by Owen, edited by Parth and Prasad
- vehicleSimulatorSpeed.m: Edited by Prasad and Frank

Note: We were all discussing over Zoom meetings. So, sometimes, Parth's ideas were committed to Git by Prasad (as he was discussing and coding). Prasad wrote the original Kalman Filter and got the initial Gaussian cost function code running. Frank and Prasad worked on getting the simulator running using Frank's initial simulation code.
